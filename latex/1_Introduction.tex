\subsection{Motivation}\label{motivation}}

In the beginning of my academical career I was aiming an educational
degree i math and physics. While studying at the University of Tübingen
I was also worked as a research assistant in the Institute of Physical
Chemistry. In the course of my studies I was allowed to spend 4 month in
a school to gain first experiences in teaching physics and math to
students between 12 and 20 years. Even though it was a great experience
and I enjoyed it a lot to bring new ideas and concepts to the students,
I also felt a strong urge to continue learning and explore. At this time
the possibilities I saw in focusing on scientific research and
development seemed more attractive to me. My reasoning was, that I might
be better for me do combine my preference for teaching and research
rather at the university than a college. Long story short, after some
years I ended up doing Phd. in the ``Institute of Theoretical and
Physical Chemistry'' at the University of Tübingen. Lucky as I was I
directly got the possibility to work in a project with an industrial
partner. The focus was on building a new state of the art gas sensors.
Besides the benefits of learning to regularly give presentations and
prepare reports, working in teams and having enough financial support
for research activities, it also imposed some new problems needed to be
solved. One of the biggest challenges was the continuous increase of
sensor date in always shorter intervals. With the increasing
industrialization and automatisation of sensor production and testing,
the quantity high quality data increased dramatically. Luck as I was, I
was not the only one facing problems with the increasing amount of data
needed to be analyzed. In the beginning of each analysis, the specific
task was not fully defined. It was rather an exploratory research to
gain an idea about possible goals. In this case the the traditional way
of creating software algorithms for well defined tasks, to take over the
heavy lifting, did not fit too well. I rather had the need for efficient
tools to reduce time consuming parts of the data analysis and a platform
to combine these tools efficiently. So at this point of my career with
my very basic knowledge in the area of programming and the need to solve
urgent tasks, I was looking for an efficient solutions with a steep
learning curve.

Until then my, and of some others in the lab, standard procedure of
working with our data was mainly based on manual feature extraction and
analysis. When Working with a limited amount of samples, manually doing
these steps was acceptable and efficient. With the industrial
cooperation gaining speed, the number of samples increased also rapidly.
Soon we reached the point where the pre-processing of the data would
easily consume a large amount of time. And that without even having
started with the analysis. Luckily I was not the only one facing such
problems and a project from the Python community gained more and more
interest. Articles like \cite{Unpingco2014} pointed me to a new way of
dealing with data and using the Python programming language. Regarding
the fact, that Python was already a well established programming
language, the introduction of the ``IPtyhon notebook ecosystem'' was
making the use of Python for in an scientific work flow very attractive.
As mentioned in this article: \cite{Osipov2016}

\begin{quote}
``\ldots{} what they do offer is an environment for exploration,
collaboration, and visualization.''
\end{quote}

I also realized the large potential for my working field. By learning
Python I got efficient tools for calculations, analysis and
representations. Additionally the new tools have been build specially
with the focus on the goal to easy report result including the way they
have been gained. The environment around the so called ``Juypter
notebooks'' was the ideal piece, which I experienced as a missing block
in the scientific work I was doing.

Besides my work for our industrial partner I also did fundamental
research about semiconducting metaloxide gas sensors. Based on great
research done before my time on gas sensors, my focus was now on
numerical calculations of the gas sensors. Typically a theoretical model
of a gas sensor is developed and the predictions are compared with
experimental results. When publishing the results the peer review system
assures, that the publications are well written, documented the on a
solid and proven basis. But when reading such papers, I had the
experience, that unfortunately many of them presented good results, but
practical instructions on how to implement the presented models were
often not given. The work of rebuilding the model and recalculating the
results was therefore often not possible in a reasonable amount of time.
This limitation can be a reason why a direct comparison model with
experimental data from other sensors is often not done. It is also worth
to mention, that in my experience the average experimental oriented
researcher does not have the required programming knowledge to easily
implement algorithm based on the presented work. But I am confident,
that if an algorithm was given in an appropriate way, most research
would benefit from the presented code.

Also with the results I gained while my Phd. thesis I was facing the
same problem. Others understood the value of my work but could not
transfer it to their particular problem. At this point my graphical
representation in the form of presentations, my detailed description and
the corresponding algorithms of my work had been three separated parts.
Facing this problem more and more, I decided not to ignore it anymore. I
made the choice to try to combine representation, description and
algorithm in one unified way. I decided to orient myself back to my
``educational roots'' and use the powerful ecosystem around the
``Jupyter notebooks'' to calculate, represent and describe the results
for my thesis for this task. This is why my thesis is written with the
large focus on suppling a introduction to this excellent toolbox.

On the one side this presented work will allow more people to gain
insides in the sensing properties of semiconducting metal oxide sensors
(SMOX). I hope that on the other side, this his thesis will also be a
useful introduction into Python, specially IPython notebooks, for
scientific work.

These hopes are not unfunded. In my time working at the ``Eberhard Karls
University of Tübingen'' i was also assigned to give multiple lectures.
One lecture branch has been the introduction to data mining. Often the
lack of programming knowledge and the limited amount of lecture time did
not allow a usage of Python as a supporting programming language. In
these cases classical tools like Excel of Origin have been used to
analyze example datasets for hidden facts. Most attendees have been very
fast and understood the general concept of data mining. Just not being
able to translate the general concept into machine understandable
instructions stopped them from using them. When enough time was
available, a short introduction into programming with Python gained a
lot of interest and was generally seen as a positive experience. With
just a short introduction already many advanced tasks can be performed,
which would often even not possible with the ``traditional'' tools.

This thesis is therefore structured in such a way, that I will present
my research results from the past years in a condensed form and
additionally uses this opportunity to introduce and explain the
importance of applying programming tools in the common work flow of
scientific work. The potential of ``outsourcing'' repetitive tasks to
machine executable scripts lies in the gain in investing more time in
creativity and intelligence solutions. My hope is to bring with this
thesis not only a deeper insight in the understanding of SMOX based gas
sensors, but also help others to start a interesting journey into the
wide area of data mining and machine learning with python.

I typically finish my introductions to Python by letting the students
run their first commands. Typically for other introductions found around
the globe, this is a program which outputs ``Hello World.''. For Python
I prefer to execute some other commands with boils almost down to the
philosophical essence on how ``instructions'' should be.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

``The Zen of Python'' might not always be the primary directive of each
developer, but the Python community consists most probably of many
people how would consider the latter points as important. So did also
the inventors of the IPython and Jupyter. A quick search will reveal
multiple sources in the world wide web giving a detailed picture about
what Notebooks are and how Jupyter in connected with them. Here I will
not try to give an general overview about this tool and rather stick to
the phrase ``Learning by doing.''. By explaining topic related parts
this notebooks will guide an interested reader to the point where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  understanding the fundamental instructions of Python
\item
  using the basic functionality of the Notebooks
\item
  fundamental understanding of SMOX based gas sensors
\end{itemize}

is gained.

It is worth mentioning, that the intention of such notebooks is to merge
the essential tools of scientific work flows together. Data acquisition,
preparation, analysis, representation and documentation all available in
one place. The strength of not just sharing final conclusions in a
nicely formatted way, but also being able to share the full stack of
steps necessary to reach the final conclusion is essentially the
strength of the Jupyter notebooks. This feature is already changing the
way how scientific results are shared/published and was intentionally
designed this way \cite{Randles2017}.

The default format of representing anything in a notebook in based on
``Markdown''. Wikipedia summarizes Markdown like this:

\begin{quote}
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting
syntax. Wikipedia
\end{quote}

This means a document is formatted by writing plaintext and special text
blocks are interpreted as formatting commands. E.g. \textbf{BOLD}
letters are generated by encapsulating the text with
\texttt{**\ Text\ here\ **}, headings are generated by starting the
heading with \texttt{\#}. Depending on the number of \texttt{\#},
subsections are created. I will not go into detail here about the
features of Markdown. Many features are used in this notebook and are
directly accessible by double-clicking the text element. The plain text
will reveal the way it was created, and the execution of the cell with
\texttt{CTRL+ENTER} will reveal its Markdown formatted representation.
One other handy feature of the Jupyter ecosystem I use is the ability to
transform notebooks into multiple other formats. Just to name some:
HTML, WORD (DOC, DOCX), Latex. The tool \texttt{nbconvert} is used
internally to convert the Markdown formatted representation into other
formats. For this thesis the default option ``Export as PDF'' under the
File option generates a Latex based PDF file.
\href{https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/}{Mastering-markdown}
is a web page, where I found some hints on how to format my notebook.
For instance I gained the ability to make block quotes from this page
based on this example:

As Kanye West said:

\begin{quote}
We're living the future so the present is our past.
\end{quote}

To learn how to use notebooks it is best to use them in an interactive
environment. The next section will explain how to obtain one for free!

    \hypertarget{installation-guide}{%
\subsubsection{Installation guide}\label{installation-guide}}

The easiest way to get started would be to use the Anaconda
distribution. Anaconda bundles multiple different tools and installs
them in the operation system. Anaconda will take care of cross
dependencies and handle the update process of the software. This is not
the only way to get started with ``Jupyter Notebooks'' but surely an
very fast and easy one.
\href{media/presentations/InstallAnaconda/Anaconda-Python.pdf}{HERE} is
additionally a presentation I use for my lectures to guide students into
the world of Python and
\href{media/presentations/InstallAnaconda/PythonÜbung.zip}{here one

Besides the first example \texttt{import\ this}, here is a very basic
example which should prepare exited reader on whats coming next.

    \hypertarget{simple-is-better-than-complex.}{%
\paragraph{``Simple is better than
complex.''}\label{simple-is-better-than-complex.}}

The Jupyter environment is equipped with ``magic commands'', which are
not part of the base programming language (i.e.~Python), but rather a
helper instruction to simplify common tasks. Magic commands always start
with \texttt{\%} and are followed with an instruction. I will
demonstrate in this example the use of the \texttt{\%pylab\ inline}
instruction. This modifies the current programming space to become a lab
nicely equipped for scientific work tasks. For instance a chemistry lab
is commonly equipped with a balance, a water tab and a fire
extinguisher, and in this case a ``pylab'' is (besindes many others)
equipped with a data handing, a plotting and a calculation tool. The
additional parameter \texttt{inline} makes sure, that the figures will
be along with this document. So let's setup a ``pylab'' and run some
lines of code. (The plotting is handled in the background by Matplotlib
\cite{Hunter2007})

    The \texttt{linspace} function generates a 5000 linear distributed
points in the interval {[}-50,50) and saves those points in the xs
variable. y is just the third power of each point. \texttt{plt.} is a
submodule defined by the magic command \texttt{\%pylab} which handels
data plotting in a very simple way.
\texttt{plt.plot(x,y,\textquotesingle{}r-\textquotesingle{})} for
example plots x vs.~y with a red line. The thesis is done in the
notebook to offer the reader the possibility to directly work with newly
gained knowledge. Therefore the upper block is a good opportunity to do
the fist steps in Python. For instance change the line format to `b'
(blue). Or to `b-.'. Change the exponent from 3 to 3.1. To do so:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  click on the code box
\item
  edit the field
\item
  Add the following line
  \texttt{plt.title(\textquotesingle{}The\ power\ law\textquotesingle{})}

\subsection{SMOX based gas sensors}\label{smox-based-gas-sensors}}

This section list a collection of high quality publications which cover
all relevant information about semiconductor based gas sensors. This
thesis is structured this way, that I will try to provide the required
background in detail at the relevant places. So reading these
publications now is not necessary to follow this thesis. This section is
therefore a good point to come back if a more detailed view on the
subject is desired. Especially when this thesis is used to apply the
presented concepts to individual research topics.

When solving numerical problems it typical to introduction some
assumptions, which are only valid under specific boundary conditions.
These assumptions simplify the problem to a level where a numerical
calculation is possible, but will reduce the validity of the results
only to a small subset of all possible situations. The calculations in
this thesis are also packed with assumptions and boundary conditions. My
intention is to supply enough information to understand the relevance of
the assumption and it's implications. With my presented work I do not
claim to calculate all aspects of SMOX gas sensors, but present a tool
which helps to understand specific aspects. The way of presenting this
knowledge should lead/motivate others to adapt the presented work to
individual other cases with completely different boundary conditions.

    \hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Since the motivation for this ``interactive'' thesis should be clear
now, I would like to come in the next section now to my actual research
topic: ``Numerical calculation of semiconducting metal oxide (SMOX)
based gas sensors''. In the \href{2-Grain-SMOX.ipynb}{next chapter} I
will demonstrate how theoretical numerical calculations are used to for
chemical sensors are used to better understand experimental results. In
the \href{3-Applying_theorie-to-practice.ipynb}{following chapter} I
will demonstrate how such knowledge could be used to improve the
performance of a sensor regarding it's sensitivity and selectivity.

    \hypertarget{about-the-pdf-version-of-this-work}{%
\section{About the PDF-Version of this
work}\label{about-the-pdf-version-of-this-work}}

This notebook was not intended to be used as a printed hard copy or as a
PDF. The provided PDF servers just as an low level representation of the
original work. It should give potentially interested readers an easy
entry point to Python (or any other programming language) supported
science. Many of the implemented features in these notebooks like
interactive widgets, animated data representations and live code
examples will not work in the PDF-version. Only a static snapshot of the
mutable representation can be represented outside the notebook, at best.
The benefits of interacting with the presented work in a notebook should
motivate the reader to use the notebook.

Nevertheless the integrated function to export a notebook to a latex
based version offers a very nice way to publish results in a printable
way. So please keep in mind, that the PDF-verison may not be able to
represent all the features of the notebook as intended and some links
might not work as expected. You are strongly encouraged to switch to the
Jupyter presentation of this work and experience the full potential of
such notebooks.

\hypertarget{equations}{%
\subsection{Equations}\label{equations}}

In a typical scientific thesis and textbook, relevant equations are
referred by numbers of identifiers. In Latex this is done, by assigning
a label and a tag to an equation. If this equation needs to be referred
to, a pointer to the reference is added, and the tag is used for the
representation of this equation. As an example, an arbitrary equation
from this thesis is used. The (internal) reference of this equation is
`second\_derivative', while the printed representation (tag) is ``Second
derivative''.

\begin{align}
\frac{d²V^{*}}{dr^{*2}}=1-n^{*}(V^{*})-\frac{2}{r^{*}}\frac{dV^{*}}{dr^{*}}\label{second_derivative}\tag{Second derivative}
\end{align}

To refer to this equation a reference can be added which will look like
this (\ref{second_derivative}). The underlying mechanisms will link the
reference with the equation, print the label, and add an hyperlink, to
be able to jump to the equation. This feature works either in notebook
or PDF representations. One drawback of the notebook representation is,
that the equation and reference need to be in the same code block/cell.
Otherwise the reference is not working. Instead of linking the equation
correctly, ??? will be represented. My opinion is, that this will change
will evolving improvements of Jupyter is is just a temporal flaw. Since
the PDF version is processed by a Latex interpreter in total, the ``one
code block'' limitation does not exist there. To demonstrate this, I
will try to reference the eqaution in the next code block.

    Here the same reference to the equation: \ref{second_derivative}. In the
PDF-Version this will work correctly and in the Notebook-Version only
??? should be visible (until now).

    \hypertarget{tables}{%
\subsection{Tables}\label{tables}}

With the numerical calculations performed in this thesis, data will need
to be represented also. One way of doing this is by plotting the the
data. This is also suitable for a static PDF-Version of this thesis,
which often is useful/necessary to have. This feature is well
implemented and the transfer from Notebook to PDF version works well.
Another way to display data are tables. Similar to the well known,
omnipresent tool for working with tables, Excel, the Python universe has
its own, but similar, tool. It's called Pandas. As a primer I will give
here a very short introduction to Pandas. What sheets are for Excel, are
Dataframes for Pandas. Here a simple example how to create a Dataframe
in analogy to the previous programming example:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{6}{\boxspacing}

\PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{}the y values will the the square of the x values}
\PY{n}{y} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{x}\PY{o}{*}\PY{o}{*}\PY{l+m+mi}{2}

\PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{}Put them in a Dataframe and reference this new Dataframe with the variable `dF`}
\PY{n}{dF} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{pandas}\PY{o}{.}\PY{n}{DataFrame}\PY{p}{(}\PY{p}{\PYZob{}}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{l+s+s1}{x}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{p}{:}\PY{n}{x}\PY{p}{,} \PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{l+s+s1}{y}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{p}{:}\PY{n}{y}\PY{p}{\PYZcb{}}\PY{p}{)}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
Using matplotlib backend: Qt5Agg
Populating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib
    \end{Verbatim}

    This simple example of a Dataframe should demonstrate the basic concept
of Dataframes. Once data is in the \texttt{DataFrame} format, the are
infinit ways to transform/slice/merge/\ldots{} it, to bring it into the
desired shape. Along this thesis, some of the functionalities of
Dataframes will be used and explained. Since the Jupyter environment is
still ``under construction'', the transfer from Juypter to PDF for
notebooks does not work to well until now. This does not mean, that is
is not possible, it is just not yet implemented in the default/vanilla
environment. This is way I want to highlight the small tweak that is at
this point still needed to have a comparable output in Juypter notebooks
and printed PDFs. To bypass this obstacle the default behavior of pandas
needs to be altered ( similar to this post:
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/a/24167756}{Latex-Tables Monkey Patch}).
This following patch brings DataFrames in the appropriate shape to by
nicely represented in both representations.

    In Jupyter notebooks the output will look very similar. In the PDF
version of this thesis, those two output will differ(, unless a newer
version of Jupyter fixed this issue.) To have this thesis in a PDF
printable form, I will use the presented patch to unify the output. On
the other side I suggest not to use this patch, and rather work with the
Jupyter notebooks and its default representation, since the patch has
also its downsides. But this would go beyond the scope of this remark
about the patch.
