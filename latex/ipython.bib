abstract = {Classification of data that arise as signals or images often requires a standardization step so that information extracted from biologically equivalent signals can be quantified for comparison across classes. Differences in global trend, total energy, high-frequency noise and/or local background can arise from variabilities due to instrumentation or conditions during data collection. This article considers some common ways in which such variation is adjusted for and introduces a generalization of the popular "standard normal variate" transformation. Based on a wavelet decomposition this generalization provides increased flexibility for normalizing spectral data affected by local background noise. Examples from three types of spectroscopy data illustrate the method and its properties. {\textcopyright} 2006-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A technique for automatically correcting the baseline of open-path Fourier transform infrared spectra is described in which the spectra are decomposed into high-frequency (details) and low-frequency (discrete approximations) information using a wavelet transform. After an appropriate number of iterations, n, the discrete approximation simulates the baseline of the spectrum. By setting the nth approximation to zero and reversing this process, the reconstructed signal contains only the high-frequency components in the original signal on a baseline that is approximately flat and at zero absorbance. When small molecules such as NH3 and CH4 are quantified by partial least-squares (PLS) regression, this process decreases the number of eigenvectors required for the analysis by two or three, increasing the ruggedness of the prediction. The baseline that is calculated is approximately the same for spectra measured at resolutions of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 cm 1. Surprisingly, the baseline that is calculated is not totally smooth, with artifacts that are caused by the analyte. The amplitude of the artifacts is directly proportional to the concentration of the analyte, so the accuracy of PLS regression is not degraded. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Martinelli2012,
abstract = {Sensing mechanisms of gas sensors depend on temperature, and this is in particular true for metal-oxide semiconductors where the peculiar role of temperature suggested the modulation of temperature as a viable method to tune selectivity and sensitivity. This principle was widely investigated in the past, and methods to design ad hoc temperature behaviors have been proposed. In this paper, instead of a priori temperature profiles, a self-adaptive temperature modulation is proposed. For the scope, a closed-loop circuit connecting the sensor resistance to the sensor heater is designed. In this condition changes in sensor resistance are reflected into changes of operating temperature. Herewith, the method is implemented with an oscillatory circuit, so with a steady resistance value the signal driving the temperature modulation converges to a periodic pattern of pulses that is specific for the sensor state. Since the relationship between resistance and temperature may depend on the quality and quantity of the gas at which the sensor is exposed, the temperature modulation signal is likely dependent on the kind of gas and its concentration. As a consequence, features describing the temperature modulation signal pattern can be used as a multicomponent variable that can allow for gas identification and quantification. The hypothesis is confirmed by simulations with electronics CAD software and experiments with a commercial metal-oxide semiconductor gas sensor. Results show that optimal gas identification and concentration are simultaneously possible with a unique sensor device. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Batzill2005,
abstract = {The study of tin oxide is motivated by its applications as a solid state gas sensor material, oxidation catalyst, and transparent conductor. This review describes the physical and chemical properties that make tin oxide a suitable material for these purposes. The emphasis is on surface science studies of single crystal surfaces, but selected studies on powder and polycrystalline films are also incorporated in order to provide connecting points between surface science studies with the broader field of materials science of tin oxide. The key for understanding many aspects of SnO2 surface properties is the dual valency of Sn. The dual valency facilitates a reversible transformation of the surface composition from stoichiometric surfaces with Sn4+ surface cations into a reduced surface with Sn2+ surface cations depending on the oxygen chemical potential of the system. Reduction of the surface modifies the surface electronic structure by formation of Sn 5s derived surface states that lie deep within the band gap and also cause a lowering of the work function. The gas sensing mechanism appears, however, only to be indirectly influenced by the surface composition of SnO2. Critical for triggering a gas response are not the lattice oxygen concentration but chemisorbed (or ionosorbed) oxygen and other molecules with a net electric charge. Band bending induced by charged molecules cause the increase or decrease in surface conductivity responsible for the gas response signal. In most applications tin oxide is modified by additives to either increase the charge carrier concentration by donor atoms, or to increase the gas sensitivity or the catalytic activity by metal additives. Some of the basic concepts by which additives modify the gas sensing and catalytic properties of SnO2 are discussed and the few surface science studies of doped SnO2 are reviewed. Epitaxial SnO2 films may facilitate the surface science studies of doped films in the future. To this end film growth on titania, alumina, and Pt(1 1 1) is reviewed. Thin films on alumina also make promising test systems for probing gas sensing behavior. Molecular adsorption and reaction studies on SnO2 surfaces have been hampered by the challenges of preparing well-characterized surfaces. Nevertheless some experimental and theoretical studies have been performed and are reviewed. Of particular interest in these studies was the influence of the surface composition on its chemical properties. Finally, the variety of recently synthesized tin oxide nanoscopic materials is summarized. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This is significant for the interpretation of work function changes measurements results because the relation between the different measured electrical resistance and surface band bending depends on the conduction model.

abstract = {The theory is developed of sensory response to reducing gases of nanostructured semiconductor oxides such as In2O3 with large concentration of electrons in the conduction band. The charge distribution in nanoparticles is determined by the functional relationship between the density of negative and positive charges inside the nanoparticles and electrons on the surface. The capture of conduction electrons by adsorbed oxygen atoms causes redistribution of electrons in the nanoparticles, thereby decreasing the near-surface electron density and the conductivity of the system. Thus, there is a functional relationship between negative charge on the surface and charge structure inside the nanoparticle, which has to be considered. The conditions for the association-dissociation reactions of oxygen molecules on the surface also change. On adsorption of a reducing gas, the Oâ ions react with the gas molecules and the electrons are released into the volume of the nanoparticles. The conductivity of the system thereby increases, which constitutes the sensory effect. The radial distributions of the conduction electrons and electrostatic potential in a nanoparticle are here calculated as a function of the hydrogen concentration in the ambient air. A kinetic scheme is developed of chemical reactions corresponding to the above sensory mechanism, and the associated equations are solved. As a result, the theoretical functional relationships of sensitivity to temperature and hydrogen concentration are established. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental data.},
