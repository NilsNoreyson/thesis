abstract = {In this paper we present experimental evidence for a conduction mechanism switch for gas sensors based on SnO2 porous, thick film sensing layers under exposure to CO in the presence of humidity. In dry air and CO concentration below 250ppm the conduction is controlled by the surface depletion layers formed by the trapping of electrons from conduction band on adsorbed oxygen species. In the presence of humidity and at CO concentration exceeding 3ppm the surface depletion layers are replaced by surface accumulation layers and the conduction mechanism changes accordingly. We also present a model that takes into account the influence of humidity at low CO concentrations.},

@article{Randolph2006,
abstract = {Classification of data that arise as signals or images often requires a standardization step so that information extracted from biologically equivalent signals can be quantified for comparison across classes. Differences in global trend, total energy, high-frequency noise and/or local background can arise from variabilities due to instrumentation or conditions during data collection. This article considers some common ways in which such variation is adjusted for and introduces a generalization of the popular "standard normal variate" transformation. Based on a wavelet decomposition this generalization provides increased flexibility for normalizing spectral data affected by local background noise. Examples from three types of spectroscopy data illustrate the method and its properties.},

Everything in the text is computable in this format and thereby invites readers to "experiment and learn" as they read. The book focuses on the core, fundamental principles of signal processing. The code corresponding to this book uses the core functionality of the scientific Python toolchain that should remain unchanged into the foreseeable future. For those looking to migrate their signal processing codes to Python, this book illustrates the key signal and plotting modules that can ease this transition. For those already comfortable with the scientific Python toolchain, this book illustrates the fundamental concepts in signal processing and provides a gateway to further signal processing concepts. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

@article{Martinelli2012,
abstract = {Sensing mechanisms of gas sensors depend on temperature, and this is in particular true for metal-oxide semiconductors where the peculiar role of temperature suggested the modulation of temperature as a viable method to tune selectivity and sensitivity. This principle was widely investigated in the past, and methods to design ad hoc temperature behaviors have been proposed. In this paper, instead of a priori temperature profiles, a self-adaptive temperature modulation is proposed. For the scope, a closed-loop circuit connecting the sensor resistance to the sensor heater is designed. In this condition changes in sensor resistance are reflected into changes of operating temperature. Herewith, the method is implemented with an oscillatory circuit, so with a steady resistance value the signal driving the temperature modulation converges to a periodic pattern of pulses that is specific for the sensor state. Since the relationship between resistance and temperature may depend on the quality and quantity of the gas at which the sensor is exposed, the temperature modulation signal is likely dependent on the kind of gas and its concentration. As a consequence, features describing the temperature modulation signal pattern can be used as a multicomponent variable that can allow for gas identification and quantification. The hypothesis is confirmed by simulations with electronics CAD software and experiments with a commercial metal-oxide semiconductor gas sensor. Results show that optimal gas identification and concentration are simultaneously possible with a unique sensor device. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The conduction mechanism in polycrystalline SnO2 thick sensing films was modeled and experimentally investigated by means of simultaneous DC electrical resistance and work function changes measurements under CO and H 2 exposure in different oxygen backgrounds. It was shown that, according to the composition of the ambient atmosphere, the conduction changes from the case in which it is controlled by the surface depletion layers to a situation in which the main contribution comes from free charge transport in the surface accumulation layer. This is significant for the interpretation of work function changes measurements results because the relation between the different measured electrical resistance and surface band bending depends on the conduction model. Furthermore, the CO sensing mechanism dependence on the oxygen amount in the ambient was explained. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Batzill2005,
abstract = {The study of tin oxide is motivated by its applications as a solid state gas sensor material, oxidation catalyst, and transparent conductor. This review describes the physical and chemical properties that make tin oxide a suitable material for these purposes. The emphasis is on surface science studies of single crystal surfaces, but selected studies on powder and polycrystalline films are also incorporated in order to provide connecting points between surface science studies with the broader field of materials science of tin oxide. The key for understanding many aspects of SnO2 surface properties is the dual valency of Sn. The dual valency facilitates a reversible transformation of the surface composition from stoichiometric surfaces with Sn4+ surface cations into a reduced surface with Sn2+ surface cations depending on the oxygen chemical potential of the system. Reduction of the surface modifies the surface electronic structure by formation of Sn 5s derived surface states that lie deep within the band gap and also cause a lowering of the work function. The gas sensing mechanism appears, however, only to be indirectly influenced by the surface composition of SnO2. Critical for triggering a gas response are not the lattice oxygen concentration but chemisorbed (or ionosorbed) oxygen and other molecules with a net electric charge. Band bending induced by charged molecules cause the increase or decrease in surface conductivity responsible for the gas response signal. In most applications tin oxide is modified by additives to either increase the charge carrier concentration by donor atoms, or to increase the gas sensitivity or the catalytic activity by metal additives. Some of the basic concepts by which additives modify the gas sensing and catalytic properties of SnO2 are discussed and the few surface science studies of doped SnO2 are reviewed. Epitaxial SnO2 films may facilitate the surface science studies of doped films in the future. To this end film growth on titania, alumina, and Pt(1 1 1) is reviewed. Thin films on alumina also make promising test systems for probing gas sensing behavior. Molecular adsorption and reaction studies on SnO2 surfaces have been hampered by the challenges of preparing well-characterized surfaces. Nevertheless some experimental and theoretical studies have been performed and are reviewed. Of particular interest in these studies was the influence of the surface composition on its chemical properties. Finally, the variety of recently synthesized tin oxide nanoscopic materials is summarized. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Shao2007,
abstract = {A technique for automatically correcting the baseline of open-path Fourier transform infrared spectra is described in which the spectra are decomposed into high-frequency (details) and low-frequency (discrete approximations) information using a wavelet transform. After an appropriate number of iterations, n, the discrete approximation simulates the baseline of the spectrum. By setting the nth approximation to zero and reversing this process, the reconstructed signal contains only the high-frequency components in the original signal on a baseline that is approximately flat and at zero absorbance. When small molecules such as NH 3  and CH 4  are quantified by partial least-squares (PLS) regression, this process decreases the number of eigenvectors required for the analysis by two or three, increasing the ruggedness of the prediction. The baseline that is calculated is approximately the same for spectra measured at resolutions of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 cm  1 . Surprisingly, the baseline that is calculated is not totally smooth, with artifacts that are caused by the analyte. The amplitude of the artifacts is directly proportional to the concentration of the analyte, so the accuracy of PLS regression is not degraded. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},
