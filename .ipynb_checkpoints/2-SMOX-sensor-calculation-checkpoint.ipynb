    "A major key figure measured is often the resistance of the sensor. Therefore one important elements in this logical path of conclusion is how electrical properties of the semiconductor result in a resistance.

    "# Motivation\n",
    "The research on semiconducting metal oxide gas sensors was focusing in the past mostly on scenarios, where oxygen is the most dominant reactive, gaseous, species in the proximity of the sensor. The adsorbed oxygen at the surface of the semiconductor lead to an interaction with the charges inside the thick film grains. Due to the trapping of the charge carrier by oxygen, a depletion layer is formed in the surface region of the semiconductor. Based on this depletion layer assumption, many investigations have successfully lead to a deep understanding of the sensing mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the assumption the existence of an depletion layer is not always valid. Recent experimental results have shown, that even under atmospheric conditions which are common in real live, the dominant impact of oxygen may be gone. It could be shown, that under conditions of 50% r.h. and low concentrations of CO (>1 ppm) in synthetic air, the depletion layer was gone and a accumulation layer manifested. The results are shown in Figure \n",
    "\n",
    "![Nitrogen switch](media/pics/external_plots/nitroline_switch_julia.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the absence of the depletion layer also most simplifications are not valid anymore. Mainly the validity of the Schottky and Boltzmann approximation are not given anymore. Facing those facts the equations to describe the transduction mechanism for a specific electrical band configurations needed a more general descriptions, which includes a depletion and accumulation layer controlled transduction mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe such a semiconductor the set of differential equations is available in literature. Since the previously used simplifications for such problems are not valid in the generalized case, finding an analytically solution exceeded by far my intellectual capabilities.This is why a I chose to go a different. Find a numerical solution for the problem by using computational power\n",
    "\n",
    "While working in the field of SMOX allready some years, I was used to describe transduction processes by assigning different parts of an analytical solution to properties of the sensor. With a numerical solution this is not possible anymore and this was certainly a drawback of this method. But on the other side the relation between an effect and a intrinsic property can be studied also in detail, when numerically solving the equations for multiple values of the intrinsic property. The influence of may be studied and an insight about the principles can be gained. Therefore the goal was first to break the problem of describing a SMOX sensor into smaller parts discreet parts and second trying to solve each of it individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upcoming chapters I will describe the different part and how they have been simplified, solved individually and combined again. Each part will also hold a section where experimental data is compared with the numerically gained results."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To elaborate the modeling of sensing, different equations, many of which are described in [sec:current models] such as the shape dependent Poisson equation or the combination between the Poisson equation, the electro-neutrality equation and the geometry dependent electrical current path, must be solved. In most cases, this is an extensive mathematical effort and therefore, the numerical computing environments Python will be used to derive numerical solutions for equations, which cannot be solved analytically, as shown below. Depending on the grains size the charge trapping at the surface has different impact on the potential and charge distribution inside the grain. For large grains compared to their Debye length ($L_D$), a charge transfer at the surface may be leave the bulk unaffected. In contrast to large grains, relative small grains may be affected through the whole grain (Figure [fig:Potential-for-spheriacal,small_1ld]). \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the influence of a the charge transfer at the surface the resulting potential distribution which propagates inside the grain is from main importance. With this knowledge the free charge carrier concentration and a position dependent resistivity can be defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "When investigating the total resistance of one grain, the pathway through the grain plays a major role. The total resistance may vary a lot based on the an-isotropic resistivity distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case of symmetric contacts on opposite sites, a graphical representation of the results from a numerical simulation of one grain with a small depletion layer is shown in (Figure 3). The resulting total resistance of one grain as a function of the surface potential can then be used as an approximation for the resistance of a full multi-grain - sensor. (Figure [fig:grain_simulation_small_depl]). The relation between surface potential change and resistance change may also be obtained experimentally as described in the previous paragraph with the Kelvin-Probe-Method (REF).By comparing the Kelvin-Probe-Data with the results from the numerical simulation a better understanding of the influence of the grain size on the performance can be gained. The fitting of the numerical parameters of the simulation to experimental data or generally fitting of data with an appropriate function can easily be performed in the presented environment. "

    "The advantages of industrialized production techniques are inline with general advantages of the SMOX-based sensor technologie. Both are:\n",

The typical spherical grains with a narrow size distribution result in high surface to volume ration. Besides the high surface area, the high number of grain-grain contacts have a positive effect on the sensitivity of the sensor, due to the high number of back to back Schottky barriers. As described in [sec:current models]such barriers are of major importance for the sensing properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the literature other geometries claim exceptional performances for multiple other shapes. As from hollow spheres to nano-rods, often the mechanism which explains the measured increase in performance is not explained. Since the aim is to gain a fundamental understanding of the shape influence while staying close to a industrialize material such exotic shapes I will keep the focus in this work on spherical grains, which are commonly used in commercial products. Nevertheless the techniques described in my work should be transferable to arbitrary and more complex shapes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the shape also the defect concentration and stochastic composition varies a lot with the preparation process. One additional goal of this thesis is to gain a better understanding about the relation of these two properties and the sensor performance.\n"

    "\n",
    "Both favorable preparation methods mentioned in the latter paragraph have been investigated under a REM (Figure [fig:REM_grain_SMOX]). The SMOX grains can be well approximated as spherical grains. The typical diameters of the grains are from 5nm to 200nm. The benefit by choosing of such a shape with a the rotational symmetry is the reduction of the complexity for the numerical calculation. Therefore the approximation of the SMOX particles as spheres was chosen. The second benefit of choosing materials prepared by rather standardized preparation routes is the availability of multiple different materials form varying laboratories around the world. These materials may vary in sizes and defect concentration but are often similar in shape. This fact is favorable when the numerical results are compared and validated with experimental data. \n",

In the first place the complex numerical description of such geometries will increase the calculation duration. Also the limited availability and variety in parameters as diameter, doping level, band gap, material composition are not favorable for to check the numerical model with experimental data."

    "Reactions at the surface (see [sec:Surface-reactions]) result in a charge transfer between the bulk of a grain and the surface. This modification of the charge density distribution inside the grain causes again a change in resistivity . By moving charges to/away from the surface, electrical potentials through the grain are generated. The electrical potential at the surface and therefore the work function of the semiconductor changes (see [subsec:Work-function]). \n",

    "Previous studies have shown, that a direct relation between surface potential, surface charge and resistance exists.

Also the direct impact of size and geometric on the transduction is not taken fully into consideration. In order to have a more general model of the SMOX materials and to include the geometric effects, the charge distribution has to be solved in a more general way.\n",
